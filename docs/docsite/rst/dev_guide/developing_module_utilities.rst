Appendix: Module Utilities
``````````````````````````

Ansible provides a number of module utilities that provide helper functions that you can use when developing your own modules. The `basic.py` module utility provides the main entry point for accessing the Ansible library, and all Ansible modules must, at minimum, import from basic.py::

  from ansible.module_utils.basic import *


The following is a list of module_utils files and a general description. The module utility source code lives in the `./lib/module_utils` directory under your main Ansible path - for more details on any specific module utility, please see the source code.
